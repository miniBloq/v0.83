	But this does not affects the SNAPI original license in any way, and DOES NOT AUTHORIZES ANY THIRD PARTY
	TO USE OR REDISTRIBUTE THE SNAPI LIBRARY UNDER THE LGPL. In other words: This exception ONLY AFFECTS the

	inconpatibility with the LGPL (so in this last case, then LGPL applies):

    Any way, we strongly believe in peace, so we would not like to see our work in any non-civil or military
